# Medicine-Store-Management
Using the DBMS concept, made python script which is connected to the Oracle SQL plus, using python script the project runs in the cmd prompt. Maintains the record of medicine stock, search using content and name, etc. 

Cx_Oracle is used in Python for Front End to connect Front End to Oracle 11g
its a alternative of pyodbc

after making a video we found that there should be one more functionality which is REMOVING OLD MEDICINES from the stock

means it may possible that some of the medicines are expired due to non popularity and it can be a tidious task in manual labour.

This is the very useful functionality as we can not compromise with patient's health

I have exported my full schema of project
If you want to check then login as sysdba and then import it as
